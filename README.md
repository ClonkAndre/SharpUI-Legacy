# SharpUI
SharpUI is a library that allows you to create your own Rockstar-like menus for Grand Theft Auto IV.  
  
This version is only compatible with IV-SDK .NET v0.9.2 and below thus the "legacy" in the name.  
To find the version which is compatible with later versions of IV-SDK .NET, check out the [SharpUI-ImGui](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/SharpUI-ImGui) project.
